# Time-series-analysis
Here basic time serieses and their prediction process are discussed:
There are four types of series basically:
1) Trend
2) seasonal
3) coorelative 
4) Noise

And basic prediction techniques include:
1) taking the value of prvious timestep
2) averaging window
3) Differencing and averaging


These all are discussed in this notebook!




In the second part, we have used deep learning to predict the next value in a sequence, this is very simple. Just divide the series into bunch of windows and use each window as input , and next value to window as label.
